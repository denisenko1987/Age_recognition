## Neural network estimates peoples' age by analising their faces in streaming video

This is my little pet project - a neural network that estimates people’s age in real-time video.
The project stages:
1. Collect the training dataset (I’ve found it on Kaggle)
2. Prepare and augment pictures
3. Select and fine-tune base NN
4. Save the trained model
5. Write a script that captures video from your webcam (use OpenCV), recognizes human faces on the shot and uses the saved NN model to estimate human age.
6. Enjoy)
